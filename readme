CSCE 3530 - Introduction to Computer Networks
Programming Assignment #1
Programmer: Conor Vanek
Due Date: 6/16/2023

Objective (Taken from instructions):
Create a count server that can do the following: converts single digit integers of a given
sentence to number words, counts the number of uppercase and lowercase alphabets,
and finally counts the number of special characters in an input sentence

How to compile & execute:
1: Unzip the contents of the Zip file into their own folder.
2: Navigate to the folder and run the command "make". This will compile server.c and client.c into their own executables.
3: To start the server, enter the command "./ctserver <port_number>". Replace <port_number> with a valid port number of your choice (example, 1234, 8080, etc.)
4: The server should display a message that it is now listening on the port you chose.
5: To start the client and connect to the server, enter the command "./client <port_number>". Use the same port number that the server is listening on.
6: The client window should now be prompting for input. Enter an input up to 255 characters.
7: The server will respond back as per the objective (above)


How to clean executables:
-Navigate to the folder containing source code & executables and enter the command "make clean"

Testing:
-Two test cases can be taken directly from the instructions: 
While connected to the server, in the client program type the input: 

Average US inflation will be 6% this year!

The response should be:

Output: Average US inflation will be six% this year!
Uppercase alphabets: 3
Lowercase alphabets: 29
Special Characters: 1

Input: The cost for 3 apples is $4!

The response should be:

Output: The cost for three apples is $four!
Uppercase alphabets: 1
Lowercase alphabets: 17
Special Characters: 1
